# Pokemon-Diffusion
This is a project for the course Deep Generative Diffusion Models where the goal was to implement an end-to-end diffusion model for generation of pokemon images
There are two implementations. One is a simple DDPM implementation and the other is a Classifier Free-Guidance (CFG) Based class (pokemon type) conditional generation implemented as bonus part(idea taken from [Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598)). Hence there are two (.py) files. \\
To run the script simply select which file you want to run in ```script.sh```. All the metrices will be installed inside the script. Dependencies are
